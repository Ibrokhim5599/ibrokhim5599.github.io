	<p><font face="Times new roman" color="green">Description: </font><font color="white">2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast, including Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark.
Development of Civil War began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline "Civil War", while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous Captain America films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's casting; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in the Metro Atlanta area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras (for the film's central airport fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios during the post-production process. </font>
<p><font face="Times new roman" color="green">Storyline: </font><font color="white"> With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges.</font>

<p><font face="Times new roman" color="green">Storyline: </font><font color="white"> Optimus Prime return to Cybertron to find the planet dead, and learns he’s the one to blame for it. To bring it back to life he’ll need a mysterious artifact that – we hope you’re sitting down – is on Earth.
The artifact is connected to Merlin, the sorcerer mentor to King Arthur in the legendary story. Merlin gained his magic through a visiting Transformer, not the first time the race has dabbled in altering human history (the site speculates that the artifact could be the mythical sword Excalibur, hence a sword featured in the film’s key art).
The film picks up where the previous movie left off, with Optimus Prime in space; Optimus is the main Transformers character, however
Bumblebee will take a bigger role while Optimus (presumably) seeks out Cybertron, along with Hound, Crosshairs, Drift, the Dinobots and “mini-dinobots” operating out of the South Dakota badlands. </font>

Alpha-Omega has in its service apes (called "donkeys") that had previously followed Koba, a maniacal, human-hating bonobo who led a failed coup against Caesar and started the war after leading a vengeful attack against human survivors in San Francisco.
During Alpha-Omega's attack, the human soldiers are met by heavy ape resistance. Four soldiers and a "donkey" gorilla named Red are captured by the apes. Caesar arrives and releases the human soldiers, telling them to deliver a message to the Colonel - that he killed Koba for starting the war and that he desires peace between the humans and apes. Caesar then orders that Red is to be imprisoned but Red escapes, injuring albino gorilla Winter. </font>
